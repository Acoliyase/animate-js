#### @wix/unidriver-puppeteer
- `puppeteerUniDriver` - Creates a driver for DOM element
- `puppeteerUniDriverList` - Creates a driver for list of DOM elements
- `isPuppeteerUniDriver` - Type-guard check if driver is of `puppeteer` type allowing use of specific methods for the driver,
  e.g., that are not available in common API as not all environments use real DOM.
  - narrows down `unwrap()` to return `ElementHandle` instead of `any`
  - narrows down `getNative()`***deprecated** to return `PuppeteerGetNativeResult` instead of `any`
- `PuppeteerGetNativeResult` - *type that is result of `getNative()`***deprecated** method
```typescript
  {
    element: ElementHandle;
    selector: string;
    page?: PageOrFrame;
  }
```
