 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition which is typically used to run the query using the [`find()`](#plansquerybuilder/find) method.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `PublicPlansQueryBuilder` methods onto the query. `PublicPlansQueryBuilder` methods enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryPublicPlans()` returns.
 *
 * `queryPublicPlans()` runs with the following `PublicPlansQueryBuilder` defaults that you can override:
 * - [`skip`](#plansquerybuilder/skip): `0`
 * - [`limit`](#plansquerybuilder/limit): `50`
 *
 * The methods that are chained to `queryPublicPlans()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you sort on the `_createdDate` property in ascending order and then on the `_id` property in ascending order, the results are sorted first by the created date of the items and then, if there are multiple results with the same date, the items are sorted by `_id` in ascending order, per created date value.
 *
 * The following `PublicPlansQueryBuilder` methods are supported for the `queryPublicPlans()` method. For a full description of the Plans object, see the object returned for the [`items`](#plansqueryresult/items) property in [`PublicPlansQueryResult`](#plansqueryresult).
