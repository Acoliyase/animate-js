- Common types for consumer usage
- `configureUniDriver` - called once in the test setup to configure global behaviour any `UniDriver` instances.
  Can be called with the following options:
  - `queryAttribute` - it configures `$`/`$$` driver call to wrap selector in provided attribute.
    e.g. if you pass `{queryAttribute: 'data-hook'}` and driver is
    called as `someDriver.$('some-selector)` actual dom query would be to `[data-hook="some-selector"]`.
    Very useful when you have stable selectors via `data-hook`/`data-test-id` attributes and such.


    Can also be a function, that receives a selector, for instance if you want partial match. e.g. `[data-hook~="${selector}"]`
  - `defaultTimeout` - sets the default timeout for all driver calls. Default is 1000ms.
