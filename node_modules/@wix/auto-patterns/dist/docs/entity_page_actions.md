## Entity Page Actions: `moreActions` Support

Entity pages in AutoPatternsApp support not only a primary action (such as "Save" or "Delete") but also a flexible set of **more actions** (sometimes called "secondary actions" or `moreActions`). These allow you to provide additional contextual actions for the entity, such as custom logic, or grouped actions.

> **Note:** All custom actions for entity pages must be placed in the `moreActions` array. Do not place custom actions as primary actions on entity pages. The `moreActions` array is the only supported location for custom actions on entity pages.

### Configuration Structure

- The `moreActions` property on the entity page is an **array** of action configurations that can include divider objects for visual separation.
- Each action in `moreActions` is a Custom Action (type: "custom") or a Divider (type: "divider")

#### Example: Adding custom actions with dividers to an entity page
```json
{
  "type": "entityPage",
  "entityPage": {
    // ... other config ...
    "moreActions": [
      {
        "id": "sendEmail",
        "type": "custom",
        "label": "Send Email"
      },
      {
        "id": "exportData",
        "type": "custom",
        "label": "Export Data"
      },
      { "type": "divider" },
      {
        "id": "archiveEntity",
        "type": "custom",
        "label": "Archive"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver

The `CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver` type is used to implement custom actions for the `moreActions` menu on entity pages in AutoPatternsApp. Each action in the `moreActions` array must have a corresponding resolver function registered in your overrides.

#### Function Signature

```typescript
import { CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver } from '@wix/auto-patterns/types';

export const myMoreAction: CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver = (params) => {
  const { actionParams: { entity, form } , sdk } = params;

  return {
    label: 'My More Action',
    icon: <MyIcon />, // optional
    onClick: () => {
      // Your custom logic here
    },
  };
};
```

- **entity**: The current entity data (all field values). In actionParams.
- **form**: The react-hook-form instance for the entity page. In actionParams.
- **sdk**: The AutoPatterns SDK (see SDK Utilities section).

---

#### Key Points for CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver

- The action `id` in the configuration MUST exactly match the function name exported from your actions folder.
- The implementation must use the `CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver` type.
- The implementation must be exported as a named export (not default export).
- The function receives `{ actionParams, sdk }` as parameters.
- The returned object must include at least a `label` and an `onClick` handler (optionally an `icon`).

#### Validation Checklist for More Actions

✓ Each action in `moreActions` has a unique `id` and correct `type` value
✓ Each action type only includes its required field(s)
✓ Custom actions match implementations in overrides
✓ The resolver is exported and registered in the `actions` property of your `PatternsWizardOverridesProvider`
✓ The function signature matches `CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver`
✓ The returned object includes `label`, `onClick`, and optionally `icon`

---

**Summary:**
The `CustomEntityPageMoreActionsActionResolver` enables you to add custom, contextual actions to the "More Actions" menu on your entity pages. Implement the resolver, export it, and reference it by `id` in your config for seamless integration.
