# AI Agent Instructions for AutoPatternsApp

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for AI agents to correctly generate and validate configurations for the `AutoPatternsApp` component. Follow these instructions sequentially to ensure proper implementation.

## AI Usage Guidelines

1. **Configuration Generation Process**:

   * First, analyze the schema requirements.
   * Then, select appropriate fields based on data types.
   * Finally, validate against the rules before output.

2. **Required Validation Steps**:

   * Verify exact page count (must be 2).
   * Confirm proper field selection (max 3 columns initially).
   * Check all mandatory fields are present.
   * Ensure no unsupported fields are included.
   * Verify that every collection page has a create action that navigates to the entity page.

3. **Decision-Making Priority**:

   * User explicit requirements override defaults.
   * Schema structure guides field selection.
   * Best practices determine presentation.

4. **Enum Configuration Rule (CRITICAL)**:

   * When generating `enumConfig` (whether implicitly as part of another rule or explicitly upon user request), the AI **must always ask the user to provide the possible option values** for the enum field.
   * The `value` of each option can be **any string specified by the user**, and the `label` should be derived from the `value` (e.g., if `value` is "dog", the `label` can be "Dog").
   * The AI is strictly prohibited from guessing, inventing, or assuming the enum values or their labels.

# Core Rules

## Configuration Rules

* Pages array MUST contain exactly two pages.
* Components array inside collectionPage MUST contain exactly one component with a layout array.
* Configuration MUST come only from a JSON file.
* DO NOT fill optional fields unless explicitly requested.
* Select up to 3 columns initially that best represent the entity.
* Every collection page MUST include a create action that allows users to create new entities by navigating to the entity page.

## Type Binding Rules

* If `type: 'collectionPage'`, only `collectionPage` field should exist.
* If `type: 'entityPage'`, only `entityPage` field should exist.
* No cross-mixing of types is allowed.

## Override Rules

* Custom overrides are restricted to documented areas only.
* Only override columns when specific rendering is required.

## Validation Rules

* All configurations must align with AppConfig Structure.
* Remove any configuration entries not in the structure.
* Verify customColumns.enabled logic (>5 columns or explicit request).

# Instruction Guide & Best Practices

This guide instructs on how to correctly integrate the `AutoPatternsApp` component from `@wix/auto-patterns` package into a Wix-based admin page.

# Component Purpose

The `AutoPatternsApp` is a page-level component used to display a data collection either as a Table or Grid.
It is configured using a JSON file conforming to the `AppConfig` interface and supports overrides for advanced use-cases.
