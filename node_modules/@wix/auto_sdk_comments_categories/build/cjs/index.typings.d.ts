 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [`find()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/comments/categories/categories-query-builder/find) method.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `CategoriesQueryBuilder` methods onto the query. `CategoriesQueryBuilder` methods enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryCategories()` returns.
 *
 * The methods that are chained to `queryCategories()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you apply `ascending("voteSummary.netVoteCount")` and then `ascending("replyCount")`, the results are sorted first by the `"voteSummary.netVoteCount"`, and then, if there are multiple results with the same `"voteSummary.netVoteCount"`, the items are sorted by `"replyCount"`.
 *
 * The following `CategoriesQueryBuilder` methods are supported for the `queryCategories()` method. For a full description of the categories object, see the object returned for the [`items`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/comments/categories/categories-query-result/items) property in [`CategoriesQueryResult`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/comments/categories/categories-query-result/items).
