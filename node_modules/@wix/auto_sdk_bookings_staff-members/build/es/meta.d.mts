     * `FREQ` — The frequency with which the session should be repeated (such as DAILY or WEEKLY).
     * Supported `WEEKLY` value is supported.
     * INTERVAL — Works together with FREQ to specify how often the session should be repeated. For example, FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2 means once every two weeks. Optional. Default value is 1.
     * COUNT — The number of times this event should be repeated. Not yet supported.
     * UNTIL — The UTC date & time until which the session should be repeated. This parameter is optional. When it is not specified, the event repeats forever.
     * The format is a short ISO date, followed by 'T' and a short time with seconds and without milliseconds, terminated by the UTC designator 'Z'. For example, until Jan. 19th 2018 at 7:00 AM: 'UNTIL=20180119T070000Z'.
     * BYDAY - The days of the week when the event should be repeated. Currently, only a single day is supported. This parameter is mandatory.
     * Possible values are: MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU
     * Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; session start and end times are specified in the start and end fields.
