### @wix/unidriver-common
- `UnidriverBase` - Base abstract class for all adapters. Meant for usage only inside the monorepo. It implements the wiring, time budgeting,
  and complex error handling aimed to give the most complete, precise errors. Every adapter
  implements a set of primitive methods, that are defined as callbacks that receive underlying element as first argument and implement how actual
  interactions with it are being done. e.g. `click`, `hover`, which differ depending on the env. Typical adapter takes around as few as 70 LOC to implement,
  Adapter can override base methods as well as make `super` calls to any fn. Callbacks are called by the abstract class from `UnidriverBase`.
  This allows keeping all logical wiring consistent and getting similar behavior in multiple usage scenarios as well as
  writing minimal amount of code in adapters themselves, keeping them slim and easy to implement.
- `UndriverBaseList` - The same as UniDriverBase, but for wrapping multiple elements.
- `bindUniDriverApiMethods`, `bindUniDriverListApiMethods`, `isOfType` - utility functions
#### @wix/unidriver-common/testing
- Set of common tests for every adapter to ensure similar behavior.
