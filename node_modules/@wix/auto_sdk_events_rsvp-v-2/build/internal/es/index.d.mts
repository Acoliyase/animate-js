     * The `queryRsvps()` method builds a query to retrieve a list of RSVPs and returns an `RsvpsQueryBuilder` object.
     *
     * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the `find()` method.
     *
     * You can refine the query by chaining `RsvpsQueryBuilder` methods onto the query. `RsvpsQueryBuilder` methods enable you to sort, filter, and control the results `queryRsvps()` returns.
     *
     * `queryRsvps()` runs with these `RsvpsQueryBuilder` defaults, which you can override:
     *
     * - limit(50)
     * - descending("_createdDate")
     *
     * The methods that are chained to `queryRsvps()` are applied in the order they're called. For example, if you apply ascending('status') and then descending('eventId'), the results are sorted first by the status, and then, if there are multiple results with the same status, the items are sorted by event ID.
     *
     * **Note:** This method is quite slow. We suggest you using the following filter pairs for the most optimal speed:
     * - `eventId` and `status`
     * - `eventId` and `fullyCheckedIn`
     * - `eventId` and `memberId`
     * - `eventId` and `contactId`
