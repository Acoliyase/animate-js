For recently created unpaid bookings, this typically matches the original booking price. However, this method calculates prices based on the service's current pricing configuration, so the returned price may differ from the original booking price if service pricing has changed since the booking was created.
     *
     * ### Price calculation methods
     *
     * __Standard pricing__: Wix Bookings calculates prices based on the number of participants for each service variant ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/service-options-and-variants/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/services/service-options-and-variants/introduction)).
     * Specify `booking.bookedEntity.slot.serviceId` for appointment-based services and classes, or `booking.bookedEntity.schedule.serviceId` for courses.
     *
     * __Custom pricing__: When a [Pricing Service Provider Plugin](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/pricing/pricing-integration-service-plugin/introduction) is installed, Calculate Price gets responses directly from the external provider instead of using standard Wix pricing logic.
     * In this case, specify `booking.bookedEntity`. Note that external apps can't currently check whether a plugin is installed on the site before calling Calculate Price.
     *
     * To estimate the price for multiple booking line items before the booking exists, call Preview Price ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/pricing/preview-price) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/pricing/pricing-api/preview-price)) instead.
     * @param - Existing booking ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/bookings/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/bookings/bookings-writer-v2/introduction)) to calculate the base price for.
     * Must include `bookedEntity` details and participant information.
