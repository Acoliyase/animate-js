provided filters.\n *\n *\n * ### Defaults\n *\n * List Availability Time Slots uses the following defaults:\n *\n * - Sorts time slots by `localStartDate` in ascending order.\n * - `cursorPaging.limit` set to `1000`.\n * - Returns both bookable and un-bookable time slots.\n * - If `bookable` filter isn't specified, bookable slots are returned first.\n * - `fromLocalDate` is set to the current time.\n *\n * ### Filtering behavior\n *\n * The method automatically filters time slots:\n *\n * - **Past time slots**: Only time slots starting from the specified `fromLocalDate` are included. When you omit `fromLocalDate`, Wix Bookings uses the current time as the default.\n * - **Resource availability**: Only time slots with at least some available resources are returned.\n *\n * ### Service type limitations\n *\n * Only appointment-based services are supported when calling List Availability Time Slots.\n *\n * To retrieve class availability, you can call List Event Time Slots([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/bookings/time-slots/time-slots-v2/list-event-time-slots) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/time-slots/time-slots-v2/list-event-time-slots)).\n *\n * To retrieve course availability, you can follow the End-to-End Booking Flow for course([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/end-to-end-booking-flows#book-a-course) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/bookings/end-to-end-booking-flows#book-a-course)).\n *\n * ### Booking policy filtering\n *\n * Use `bookingPolicyViolations` to filter slots based on booking restrictions defined in your booking policies ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/booking-policies/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/policies/booking-policies/introduction)).\n *\n * *Default behavior**: When you don't specify any `bookingPolicyViolations` filters, all slots are returned regardless of their booking policy status.\n *\n * - Set `tooEarlyToBook` to `true` to retrieve slots that can't be booked yet due to minimum advance booking time restrictions.\n * Currently, you can't specify `earliestBookingDate` to further filter by when the slot becomes bookable.\n * - Set `tooLateToBook` to `true` to retrieve slots that can no longer be booked due to maximum advance booking time restrictions.\n * - Set `bookOnlineDisabled` to `true` or `false` to filter by online booking availability settings.\n *\n * ### Available resources\n *\n * Time slots aren't returned when they have no available resources.\n *\n * Each time slot includes details for up to 10 available resources.\n * If there are more than 10 resources, you can call Get Availability Time Slots ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/bookings/time-slots/time-slots-v2/get-availability-time-slot?apiView=SDK) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/bookings/time-slots/time-slots-v2/get-availability-time-slot)) and filter by the resource Type ID to get details for the remaining resources.\n *\n * ### Business hours exception\n *\n * Wix Bookings disregards business opening hours when all of the following conditions are met:\n *\n * 1. 1 or more staff members ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/staff-members/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/staff-members/introduction)) are needed to provide the service.\n * 2.
