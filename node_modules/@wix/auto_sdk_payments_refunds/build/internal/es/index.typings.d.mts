 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition which is typically used to run the query using the [`find()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/payments/refunds/refunds-query-builder/find) method.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `RefundsQueryBuilder` methods onto the query. `RefundsQueryBuilder` methods enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryRefunds.find()` returns.
 *
 * The query runs with the following `RefundsQueryBuilder` defaults that you can override:
 *
 * - [`skipTo(0)`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/payments/refunds/refunds-query-builder/skip-to)
 * - [`limit(50)`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/payments/refunds/refunds-query-builder/limit)
 * - [`descending("_createdDate")`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/payments/refunds/refunds-query-builder/descending)
 *
 * The methods that are chained to `queryRefunds()` are applied in the order they are called.
 *
 * The table below shows which `RefundsQueryBuilder` methods are supported for `queryRefunds()`. You can only use one filter method for each property. Only the first filter will work if a property is used in more than one filter.
